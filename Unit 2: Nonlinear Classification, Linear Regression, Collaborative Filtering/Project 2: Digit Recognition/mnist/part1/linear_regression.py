def closed_form(X, Y, lambda_factor):
    """
    Computes the closed form solution of linear regression with L2 regularization

    Args:
        X - (n, d + 1) NumPy array (n datapoints each with d features plus the bias feature in the first dimension)
        Y - (n, ) NumPy array containing the labels (a number from 0-9) for each
            data point
        lambda_factor - the regularization constant (scalar)
    Returns:
        theta - (d + 1, ) NumPy array containing the weights of linear regression. Note that theta[0]
        represents the y-axis intercept of the model and therefore X[0] = 1
